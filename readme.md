# PyTSQ Randomizer

This project is a learning project intended to be an easily extensible tool for
randomizing the cards used in a non-epic game of Thunderstone Quest.  Future
versions will also contain the ability to select specific quests and have the 
correct card lists shown.  Eventually this will grow to be a component of a 
digital version of TSQ

## How To Use

***

In its current state pyTSQ Randomizer can be used to create a fully randomized game of Thunderstone Quest.  To do this simply call the class GameRandomizer using the quests you wish to draw from as parameters.  These parameters should be entered as quest_x where "x" is the quest number.

```
from TSQ_Randomizer.pyTSQR import GameRandomizer

a = GameRandomizer("quest_1", "quest_9")
print(a.ranomized_decks)
```

To create a new randomized set of decks, perhaps because you weren't in love with the first ones you got, simply call the select_from_pool method and print the randomzied decks class variable again.

```
a.select_from_pool()
print(a.randomized_decks)
```
