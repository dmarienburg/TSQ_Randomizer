# PyTSQ Randomizer

This project is a learning project intended to be an easily extensible tool for
randomizing the cards used in a non-epic game of Thunderstone Quest.  Future
versions will also contain the ability to select specific quests and have the 
correct card lists shown.  Eventually this will grow to be a component of a 
digital version of TSQ
